# Regression-with-trees
Winemaking is a challenging and competitive business that offers the potential for great profit. However, there are numerous factors that contribute to the profitability of a winery. As an agricultural product, variables as diverse as the weather and the growing environment impact the quality of a varietal. The bottling and manufacturing can also affect the flavor for better or worse.Even the way the product is marketed, from the bottle design to the price point, can affect the customer's perception of taste.


As a consequence, the winemaking industry has heavily invested in data collection and machine learning methods that may assist with the decision science of winemaking.For example, machine learning has been used to discover key difference in the chemical composition of wines from different regions, or to identify the chemical factors that lead a wine to taste sweeter.


In this case study, we will use regression trees and model trees to create a system capable of mimicking expert rating of wine.Because trees result in a model that is readily understood, this can allow the winemakers to identify the key factors that contribute to better-rated wines.Perhaps, more importantly, the system does not suffer from the human elements of tasting, such as the rater's mood or palate fatigue. Computer-aided wine testing may therefore result in a better product as well as more objective,consistent,and fair ratings.


The data include examples of red and white Vinho Verde wines from Portugal-one of the world's leading wine-producing countries.Because the factors that contribute to a highly rated wine may differ between red and white varieties, for this analysis we will examine only the more popular white wines.
